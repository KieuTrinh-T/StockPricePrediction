# Stock Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Google stock price on real time data. I used past 10 years worth of historical Google (GOOGL) stock data for training and built an effective model for predicting stock prices and displayed the predictions on webpage using Flask, Kafka and Highcharts. Then deployed my project on AWS EC2 instance.
